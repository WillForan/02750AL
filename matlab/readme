Create k-folds of the data
  for each fold
    XXXX randomly select 10% of the tranning data (call this trainingSubset)
    select intial with random (or kmeans)

    count number of postive instances in this selection

    train on trainingSubset
    classify on all training Set (reaches 100% of trained at last iteration)
    classify on test partion     (to get accuracy)

     for each selection method 
	while(trainingSubset != training)
	    pick next n (BatchSize) instances to add to trainingSubset using whatever method
	    train on new trainingSubset

	    classify on {training,test}
	--exhausted training partion
    --completed for all methods
   --exhuasted folds

   average results over all folds
